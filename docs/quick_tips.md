- All nodes can be connected. Meaning no node has any particular data type.
- There is one small note to above. The Output Node when connected to the Erosion Node,
will give more options for which layers to convert to images. This is done for convinience,
so that user does not have to connect each layer to different Output Nodes. 
More on this [here](io_nodes.md#image-output-node).
- Make sure to select 'Fake User' (looks like a Shield Icon) to save the node tree, otherwise
it might get lost. [More info here](getting_started.md#make-sure-to-select-fake-user-otherwise-your-node-setup-will-be-lost)
