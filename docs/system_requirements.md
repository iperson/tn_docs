 - Windows 10 x64
 - NVIDIA GPU compute capability 3.5 and above. See [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#cite_ref-33) for compatible NVIDIA GPUs. Resolution of terrain erosion will depend on GPU RAM (in testing 8GB GPU RAM allowed 8196x8196 resolution). Support for CPU processing will be added in the following months.

 CPU simulation and Linux support is planned for future releases.
